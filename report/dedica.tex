\itshape I would like to sincerely thank Nicola, Ruben, and Alessio for supporting me in a moment of difficulty and for never stopping believing in me during this intense period of personal growth and study. \\ \vspace{5mm}

I am grateful to my family, especially my parents Clara and Andrea, my brother Daniele, and Cristina, for always being by my side and supporting me throughout the journey that has brought me here today. \\ \vspace{5mm}

A special thought also goes to my second family, my colleagues and employers at ``Gruppo DE'', whose presence has given me the strength and motivation to always stay on my path, supporting and shaping me during these five years of work and friendship. \\ \vspace{5mm}

I would also like to thank all my friends and colleagues who, day after day, make me happy and never let me feel alone.
