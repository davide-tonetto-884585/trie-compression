\chapter{Introduction}
The aim of this thesis is to study a new technique for the compression of labeled trees. The aim of the project is to implement and experiment with the technique, and to compare it with other state-of-the-art techniques for tree compression such as the Extended Burrows-Wheeler Transform (XBWT) \cite{ferragina2009compressing}. 

\section{The idea}
In order to compress a labeled tree,
